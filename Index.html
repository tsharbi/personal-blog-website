          Working remotely is undoubtedly having its moment. And, while some may
          still be adjusting to their new routine, there is a silver lining.
          Working remotely is effective. It keeps employees engaged and
          productive. For you, that means better performances, lower turnover
          and the ability to attract top talent. You also don't have to worry
          about rent or utility

            HTML 5 adds a lot of new features to the HTML specification, and it
            is easy to implement. You use the HTML 5 doctype, which is simple
            and streamlined: <b> !doctype html </b> Yes, that's it. Just two
            words "doctype" and "html." It can be this simple because HTML 5 is
            no longer part of <i>SGML</i> but is instead a markup language all
            on its own. The character set for HTML 5 is streamlined as well. It
            uses <u>UTF-8, </u>
            <q>and you define it with just one meta tag</q>

            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a simple mechanism for adding style
            (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing) to Web documents. CSS3 is the latest
            evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at
            extending CSS2.1. It brings a lot of new features and additions,
            like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or animations,
            as well as new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid
            layouts.

            JavaScript (or ECMA Script) is an evolving language with lots of
            proposals and ideas on how to move forward. TC39 (Technical
            Committee 39) is the committee responsible for defining JS standards
            and features, and they have been quite active this year. Here is a
            summary of some proposals that are currently in "Stage 3", which is
            the last stage before becoming "finished". This means that these
            features should be implemented in browsers and other engines pretty
            soon. In fact, some of them are available now.
