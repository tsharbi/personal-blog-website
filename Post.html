            Working remotely is undoubtedly having its moment. And, while some
            may still be adjusting to their new routine, there is a silver
            lining. Working remotely is effective. It keeps employees engaged
            and productive. For you, that means better performances, lower
            turnover and the ability to attract top talent. You also don't have
            to worry about rent or utility costs, and it's beneficial for the
            environment. Of course, these benefits are only possible if you're
            able to manage your team from afar effectively. To achieve that
            goal, you first need to avoid the following eight mistakes. <br />
            <strong>1. Being too rigid.</strong> <br />
            What's the best thing about working remotely? It's not wearing comfy
            clothes all day. It's not having to follow a strict traditional work
            schedule, like the standard 9-to-5. Instead, it's the ability and
            flexibility to work whenever is best for you and your team. Why's
            that so important? For starters, we all have different times when
            we're most productive. For example, some of your team members may be
            the most productive first thing in the morning, while others are
            later in the day. What's more, remote work allows employees to have
            more balance in their lives. If the COVID-19 pandemic has proven
            anything, it's that there will be times when it's essential to work
            remotely. Right now is one of those times, since some of your people
            may have to homeschool their children. Also, according to a 2020
            Deloitte study, "nearly all respondents say they would benefit from
            work flexibility (94 percent).<q>The top advantages are</q> being
            less stress/improved mental health (43 percent) and better
            integration of work and personal life (38 percent)." As a
            consequence, you'll have a happier, healthier and more productive
            team. <br />
            <strong>2. Failure to communicate.</strong> <br />
            If there's a drawback with working remotely, it's that communication
            can be a problem. Instead of leaving your team to their own devices,
            make sure that you schedule regular check-ins with them. You may
            have to put in a little more effort here, as opposed to just
            stopping by their workspaces or holding problem-solving sessions,
            but it's not impossible. Thanks to email, Slack or virtual meeting
            tools like Zoom, you can achieve this. In short, make sure that you
            are frequently in touch with your team. Just make sure that you do
            so through both group gatherings and personal one-on-ones. <br />
            <strong>3. Being disrespectful of everyone else's time. </strong>
            <br />
            Let's say that you live on the east coast and want to plan a meeting
            at 9 a.m. At first, that might not seem like an unreasonable demand.
            But, if you have team members who reside on the west coast, you're
            now asking them to have a meeting at 6:00 a.m. Even if all the
            attendees are in the same time zone, you may also schedule virtual
            meetings at inopportune times. Employees may be watching their
            children or focused on deep work. Remember, everyone has their own
            peak productivity hours and their personal lives that need
            attending. <br />
            <strong>4. Social disconnect.</strong> <br />
            Your remote team needs to socialize. In fact, because of recent
            events, more and more studies are examining the consequences of
            isolation. And, suffice today, it's just not good for anyone's
            health and wellbeing. Besides, encouraging your team to socialize
            with each other builds rapport and improves collaboration. <br />
          </p>
          <strong>5. Lack of feedback or learning opportunities. </strong>
          <br />
          One-on-one meetings? Check. Employee surveys? You know it. Are you
          conducting annual performance reviews? Yep. Despite all of these, data
          collected by Know Your Team, though, shows that 80 percent of the
          1,468 employees surveyed wanted even more feedback regarding their
          performance. "What it illustrates is a strong desire from your team to
          receive even more critiques, suggestions, and ideas  —  the bad along
          with the good  —  about what they can be doing better," adds Claire
          Lew. "You might think you're giving enough of it, but you could be
          giving even more." <br />
          <strong>6. Failing to address your team's struggles. </strong> <br />
          I don't want to sound hyperbolic here. But, your employees are going
          through some stuff right now. Even if we weren't amid a pandemic, they
          would still have some hurdles to jump. <br />
          <strong>7. Not using the right tools. </strong> <br />
          Let's keep this final mistake short and sweet. Your team needs
          communication, file-sharing and project-management tools at the
          minimum. Depending on their role, they may also need more specific
          tools. Regardless, you need to make sure that they have access to
          these so that they can get their work done and collaborate with each
          other.
